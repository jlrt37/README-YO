I, Joshua Ragon, will take EVERY OPPORTUNITY to advance myself with abandon
Good intentions WILL NOT achieve my goals
Success is NOT what I know, but WHAT I DO with what I know
I EXPECT and WELCOME, the struggle, the learning, the effort, and the growth
I Understand that my level of success is determined by my level of commitment
I will ALWAYS FAVOR ACTION over talking, wishing, hoping, and wondering
I WILL ALLOW MYSELF to achieve my dreams
I'm a FULL ASS STACK DEVELOPER!
